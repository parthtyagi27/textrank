My name is Optimus Prime. I am from the planet Cybertron. You betrayed Cybertron, our home. You're the one that taught me freedom is everyones right. You were the best of us, but you could never make the hard choices. All I ever wanted was to be in charge. Besides, who would you be without me Prime. Time to find out. You didn't betray me, you betrayed yourself.
